# API

The API project serves as the entry point for the entire application. It's responsible for handling HTTP requests,
managing authentication and authorization, and orchestrating interactions between different modules.

The project is configured to use JWT for authentication and authorization. Users are required to
authenticate using a valid JWT token to access secured endpoints.
